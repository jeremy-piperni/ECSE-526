Compile the gameserver and simple client with ./build
Run the gameserver with java -jar DC4Server.jar

Run the sample client with ./sampleclient [-c color] [-p port] serverhost

You will need to run two such clients, possibly on different machines, to see an actual game interaction.
Make sure to specify different colors for the two agents, e.g.,


./sampleclient -c white <serverhost> 
./sampleclient -c black <serverhost>

You can also interact manually with the gameserver using netcat (or "nc"), initiating the connection with:

nc <serverhost> <port>
